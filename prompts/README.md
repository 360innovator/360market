# Prompts

This directory contains language model prompt templates and trigger definitions. Use these prompts to automate analyses, generate reports, or integrate with Gemini Ultra and DeepSeek.

## Contents
- `sample_prompt.md` – example prompt structure including variables for dynamic values.
- `triggers.json` – JSON describing conditions for auto-tagging and prompt execution.

Prompts should be concise yet precise, following best practices for LLM alignment and safety. Adjust variables as needed to suit your data and workflows.
