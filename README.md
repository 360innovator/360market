## Data Logger Architecture

The project includes a enterprsise Grade data logger that records order and pricing information. Logs are stored in the `data/logger` directory.

### Adding Logs

1. Place JSON log files into `data/logger`. See `data/logger/README.md` for format details.
2. Each log should capture the customer order, prices pulled from the API, and any processed KPI results.
3. Run `python data/logger/validate_log.py` to ensure all log files match the expected schema before using them in other modules.

These logs can later be processed by analytics tools or uploaded to your data warehouse.
