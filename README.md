### Logger

This repository requires **Python 3.8+** to run the logger and tests.

## Data Logger Architecture

The project includes a simple data logger that records order and pricing information. Logs are stored in the `data/logger` directory.

### Adding Logs

1. Place JSON log files into `data/logger`. See `data/logger/README.md` for format details.
2. Each log should capture the customer order, prices pulled from the API, and any processed KPI results.
3. Run `python data/logger/validate_log.py` to ensure all log files match the expected schema before using them in other modules.
4. Optionally run `python data/logger/summarize_logs.py` to aggregate metrics and generate a brief Gemini-based summary.

These logs can later be processed by analytics tools or uploaded to your data warehouse.

## Continuous Integration

Log validation runs automatically via GitHub Actions. The workflow
located at `.github/workflows/validate-logs.yml` executes
`python data/logger/validate_log.py` whenever log files change. This
prevents invalid logs from being merged.

Run the script locally with:

```bash
python data/logger/validate_log.py
# or on Windows PowerShell
./scripts/validate_logs.ps1
```

## Azure Deployment

Automated deployments are configured with the GitHub Actions workflow
located at `.github/workflows/azure.yml`. On each push to `main` the
pipeline builds the React app, runs the Python tests, and uploads the
contents of the `dist` folder to Azure Static Web Apps.

Create the following repository secret to enable deployments:

- `AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APPS_API_TOKEN` â€“ deployment token for your Static Web App.

Commit and push changes with:

```bash
./scripts/push_to_github.sh "your commit message" <repo-url>
```

The script stages all files, commits, optionally sets the remote, and
pushes to the `main` branch.
