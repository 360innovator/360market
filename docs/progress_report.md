# Project Progress Report

This document tracks high-level progress on the data logger and related tooling.

## Current Status
- **Base template**: repository was initialized from an Amplify React+Vite starter but is now being migrated to Firebase services.
- **Data logger**: `data/logger` folder stores JSON logs with a documented schema.
- **Architecture**: main `README.md` includes a system diagram showing how the data logger feeds KPI and AI modules.
- **Blueprint**: `docs/enterprise_data_logger_blueprint.md` outlines a detailed design for an enterprise logger.
- **Dataset layout**: proposed subfolders (`raw_data`, `trigger_logs`, `quant_search`) to organize CSV and JSON data for grants and analytics.

## What is Missing
- Structured CSV/JSON datasets have not been added yet.
- Automated ingestion and validation scripts are not implemented.
- Linting fails because there is no ESLint configuration.

## Recommendation
The repository already contains useful documentation and initial structure. Rather than starting over, continue building on the current codebase:
1. Create the planned subfolders under `data_logger` and begin populating them with sample data.
2. Add ingestion scripts or utilities to validate and process the logs.
3. Set up linting or other automated checks as needed.

Keeping this foundation will save time and maintain continuity with existing docs.
