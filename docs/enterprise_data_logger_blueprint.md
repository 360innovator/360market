# Enterprise-Grade Data Logger Blueprint

This document summarizes the planned architecture for a robust data logging system that supports real-time ingestion, AI-driven analysis and actionable business intelligence.

## Purpose

The logger is intended to collect operational data across the platform and provide continuous security, performance and business insights. It goes beyond simple storage by enabling automated processing and daily reporting.

## Key Capabilities

- **Real-time ingestion** using webhooks and APIs.
- **AI-driven processing** leveraging LLMs (Gemini and DeepSeek) for anomaly detection, summarisation and automated updates.
- **Actionable analytics** via quantitative formulas ("Quantz") to generate KPIs and predictive insights.

## Architecture Overview

| Layer | Technology Examples | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ingestion | Webhooks, REST/GraphQL APIs, Kafka | Capture high-volume data streams |
| Processing | Apache Spark/Flink, message queues | Transform and enrich data in real time |
| Storage | Data lake (S3, ADLS) and warehouse (Redshift, BigQuery) | Store raw logs and structured datasets |
| Analytics | Grafana/Looker/Tableau plus LLM APIs | Visualize metrics and generate daily summaries |
| Security | IAM, encryption, API governance | Protect data and enforce compliance |

## Data Quality KPIs

To ensure reliable analytics, the following metrics should be tracked:

- **Completeness** – percentage of required fields populated.
- **Uniqueness** – detection of duplicate records.
- **Consistency** – adherence to defined schemas across systems.
- **Timeliness** – how quickly data becomes available for analysis.
- **Validity** – conformance to expected formats and rules.
- **Accuracy** – correctness of values captured.

## Operational Recommendations

1. Use structured JSON logging to simplify downstream processing.
2. Store logs in a central location separate from production systems.
3. Implement retry mechanisms and idempotent operations for webhook delivery.
4. Schedule LLM summarisation jobs during off‑peak hours to reduce cost.
5. Continuously monitor system health and data quality with automated alerts.

This blueprint serves as a starting point for implementation. Future iterations can expand on ETL details, security policies and additional KPIs as the system evolves.
