# Data Logger Datasets

This directory organizes raw data and trigger logs collected from the application. It is separate from `data/logger`, which stores example JSON log files.

```
/data_logger/
  ├── raw_data/            # CSV exports from daily operations
  ├── trigger_logs/        # Signals related to grant and investor opportunities
  └── quant_search/        # Reference data from public APIs and programs
```

Each subfolder will contain the corresponding files described in project documentation.
